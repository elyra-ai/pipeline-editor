      //  - there could be situations where files all have the same name, but
      //    have different folders: `one/index.py` `two/index.py` would both
      //    become `index.py`. This could make it difficult for the user to find
      //    the right file for the node.
      //
      // Option 2: guess the base path by finding a common ancestor.
      //  - this will be wrong if there aren't any files next to the pipeline.
      //  - this will also be wrong if a file falls outside the base path.
      //
      // Going with `option 1`, because it is much simpler.
