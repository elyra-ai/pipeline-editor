## Community Roles

### Contributors

Contributors are Members who are active/inactive contributors to the community. They can have issues and Pull Requests assigned to them. Contributors can be active in many ways including but not limited to:

- Authoring or reviewing PRs on GitHub
- Filing or commenting on issues on GitHub
- Contributing community discussions (e.g. Slack, meetings, Gitter, email discussion forums, Stack Overflow, etc)
- Creator of content, promotion and advocating

Active Contributors are defined as anyone from the community with twenty (20) or more measurable contributions
during the previous 12-month period, inclusive of code merged, code reviews performed, documentation page edits,
(creation, modification, comments or attachments)

### Committers

Contributors who give frequent and valuable contributions to a subproject of the Project can have their
status promoted to that of a Committer for that subproject. A Committer has write access to the source code
repository and gains voting rights allowing them to affect the future of the subproject.

In order for a Contributor to become a Committer, another Committer can nominate that Contributor or the Contributor can ask for it.
Once a Contributor is nominated, all Committers will be asked to vote. If there are at least 3 positive votes and no negative
votes, the Contributor is converted into a Committer and given write access to the source code repository.
